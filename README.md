## How I Built the Application

The application was built following the instructions of the assignment, which required recreating a given UI mockup. I started by setting up a new Expo project and installing the necessary dependencies for navigation and icons. The application features a bottom tab navigator with screens for Home, My Cards, Statistics, and Settings. Each screen was styled to closely match the provided UI design using custom components and React Native's styling system. A context was created to manage the theme (light and dark modes) across the application. The theme switch feature was implemented in the Settings screen, allowing users to toggle between themes seamlessly.
